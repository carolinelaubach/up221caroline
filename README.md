i am a second year MPP (public policy) student orginally from Washington state
i like to read about urban forestry, green infrastructure, water conservation & recycling, and social policy
my hobbies include going on walks, collecting vinyl, and taking care of my houseplants 
my dream project is to map data storage centers in the US and do a hotspot analysis of cost of water to determine if cost has risen for residents after the construction of data storage/management centers in their areas. I would also like to do a project centered around digital equity in Long Beach -- that is what my capstone project is on.
